## 10.3.1 Introduction

-   Working through "Create a Player Object" Issue on GitHub
-   Complete `Enemy` issue because similar to `Player`

Goals:

1. Write Jest tests that fake data updates to check multiple conditions
2. Use built-in Array prototype methods

## 10.3.3 Test and Build Player's Health Methods

Add methods to `Player()`

### Starting with `getHealth()` Method

-   creating the method in `Player` declutters. When we create `Game`, it only displays the game's data.
-   `expect.stringContaining()` is an expect method we can use to make sure our string includes our player's health.

```
test("gets player's health value", () => {
  const player = new Player('Dave');

  expect(player.getHealth()).toEqual(expect.stringContaining(player.health.toString()));
});
```

-   run test knowing it fails
-   using `expect.stringContaining()` in order to make sure string includes player health. It's also unspecific enough to allow flexibility if/when we change how it's displayed.

add `getHealth()` method to `Player.js` prototype:

```
Player.prototype.getHealth = function() {
  return `${this.name}'s health is now ${this.health}!`;
};
```

-   make sure test passes

-   check if player is alive:
-   Remember, truthy values are values that will be coerced to true in Boolean contexts, such as inside if statements.

```
test('checks if player is alive or not', () => {
  const player = new Player('Dave');

  expect(player.isAlive()).toBeTruthy();

  player.health = 0;

  expect(player.isAlive()).toBeFalsy();
});
```

-   add `isalive` method:

```
Player.prototype.isAlive = function() {
  if (this.health === 0) {
    return false;
  }
  return true;
};
```

-   write another test to handle `reduceHealth()`

```
test("subtracts from player's health", () => {
  const player = new Player('Dave');
  const oldHealth = player.health;

  player.reduceHealth(5);

  expect(player.health).toBe(oldHealth - 5);

  player.reduceHealth(99999);

  expect(player.health).toBe(0);
});
```

N.B.: **Create a new instance of the object being tested in every test.**

-   to start fresh,
-   test in isolation,
-   avoid unintended consequences.

add `reduceHealth()` method:
```
Player.prototype.reduceHealth = function(health) {
  this.health -= health;

  if (this.health < 0) {
    this.health = 0;
  }
};
```
