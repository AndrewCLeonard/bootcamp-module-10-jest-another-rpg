## 10.2.1 Introduction: Create a Player Object

-   Write constructor methods using JavaScript's prototype.
-   Write tests that verify proper method usage.
-   Mock a new Potion object upon creation of a Player object.

### Mocking

"faking" data to ensure that each test focuses on a singular purpose. Sometimes, constructors have other dependencies which aren't directly related to the feature you're testing.

Last lesson: `Potion()` constructor with `name` and `value` properties

### 10.2.2 Goals:

-   Create `Player()` constructor with `name` and `value`.
-   start player with two potions
-   write methods for the `Player` object to retrieve information about the player.

### Create Test for Player _Before_ Writing Constructor

```
test('creates a player object', () => {
    const player = new Player('Dave');

    expect(player.name).toBe('Dave');
    expect(player.health).toEqual(expect.any(Number));
    expect(player.strength).toEqual(expect.any(Number));
    expect(player.agility).toEqual(expect.any(Number));
});
```
- you can test a single test by using `npm run test Player` or `npm run test Potion`.

## 10.2.4 Write a Player Constructor to Pass the Test
Test created to check for proper creation of a `Player` object. Now, write the constructor function.

code in `Player.test.js`:
```
const Player = require('../lib/Player');

test('creates a player object', () => {
    const player = new Player('Dave');

    expect(player.name).toBe('Dave');
    expect(player.health).toEqual(expect.any(Number));
    expect(player.strength).toEqual(expect.any(Number));
    expect(player.agility).toEqual(expect.any(Number));
});
```

code in `Player.js`:
```
function Player(name = '') {
    this.name = name;

    this.health = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 95);
    this.strength = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5 + 7);
    this.agility = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5 + 7);
}

module.exports = Player;
```
- ES6 allows you to set empty string if no `name` is provided.
