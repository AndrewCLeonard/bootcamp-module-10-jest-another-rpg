## 10.2.1 Introduction: Create a Player Object

-   Write constructor methods using JavaScript's prototype.
-   Write tests that verify proper method usage.
-   Mock a new Potion object upon creation of a Player object.

### Mocking

"faking" data to ensure that each test focuses on a singular purpose. Sometimes, constructors have other dependencies which aren't directly related to the feature you're testing.

Last lesson: `Potion()` constructor with `name` and `value` properties

### 10.2.2 Goals:

-   Create `Player()` constructor with `name` and `value`.
-   start player with two potions
-   write methods for the `Player` object to retrieve information about the player.

### Create Test for Player _Before_ Writing Constructor

```
test('creates a player object', () => {
    const player = new Player('Dave');

    expect(player.name).toBe('Dave');
    expect(player.health).toEqual(expect.any(Number));
    expect(player.strength).toEqual(expect.any(Number));
    expect(player.agility).toEqual(expect.any(Number));
});
```
- you can test a single test by using `npm run test Player` or `npm run test Potion`.
