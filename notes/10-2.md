## 10.2.1 Introduction: Create a Player Object

-   Write constructor methods using JavaScript's prototype.
-   Write tests that verify proper method usage.
-   Mock a new Potion object upon creation of a Player object.

### Mocking

"faking" data to ensure that each test focuses on a singular purpose. Sometimes, constructors have other dependencies which aren't directly related to the feature you're testing.
